# Land Registration using Blockchain

The Land Registry project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on blockchain technology aimed at revolutionizing the land registration process. 

Leveraging smart contracts, it ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof recording of land ownership transactions. 

Through blockchain's immutable ledger, it mitigates fraud and disputes while enhancing trust in property transactions. 

The DApp facilitates seamless interaction between property owners, government authorities, and potential buyers, streamlining the transfer and verification of land titles. 

With its user-friendly interface and robust backend, Land Registry simplifies and modernizes land registration, ushering in a new era of efficiency and reliability in real estate transactions.
